# Magic Grid

## Description

The **Magic Grid** is an interactive web-based grid system where each cell's background color can be changed to red upon a click. If a cell is already red, clicking it again will display a message alerting the user that the cell cannot be changed. This project provides a simple, fun way to practice DOM manipulation and event handling in JavaScript.

## Features

- A grid of clickable cells.
- Each cell's background color changes to red on click.
- Once a cell is red, it cannot be changed again. An alert message is displayed when trying to click an already red cell.
- Responsive design to fit different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the web page.
- **CSS**: Styles to design the grid and layout.
- **JavaScript**: Event handling and DOM manipulation for interactive behavior.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/magic-grid.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd magic-grid
   ```

3. Open the `index.html` file in a browser to see the grid in action.

## How to Use

- Open the `index.html` file in any modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.).
- Click on any grid cell to change its background color to red.
- If a cell is already red, clicking it again will trigger an alert saying "This cell is already red and cannot be changed."

## Code Explanation

- **HTML**: The grid is created with multiple `<div>` elements, each with the class `grids`.
- **CSS**: The grid layout is styled using CSS Grid and Flexbox for centering the content. Each grid item has an initial background color and text.
- **JavaScript**: A click event listener is attached to each grid item. When a grid item is clicked, its background color is changed to red if it's not already red. If the cell is already red, an alert is displayed.

## Future Improvements

- Add animations to change the color of the grid items.
- Make the grid size dynamic (e.g., based on user input or screen size).
- Enhance the user interface with hover effects or tooltips.
